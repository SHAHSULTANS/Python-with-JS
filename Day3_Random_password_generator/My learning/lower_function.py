#In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are created. The lower() function does not modify the original string; instead, it returns a new string with all characters converted to lowercase


#In JavaScript 
#let email = "Alice@Example.com";
# let lowercasedEmail = email.toLowerCase();


email_list = ["Alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "CHARLIE@example.com"]

for email in email_list:
    print(email.lower())
    

    
print(email_list)
